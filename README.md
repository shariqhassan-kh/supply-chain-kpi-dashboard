# Supply-Chain-Demand-Sales-KPI-Dashboard-AdventureWorks-Dataset-
This dashboard analyzes demand patterns across products, customers, and regions. Although the dataset is sales-based, the insights help supply chain teams plan procurement, safety stock, warehouse positioning, and distribution networks. By identifying high-demand SKUs and regional sales hotspots, this dashboard supports smarter inventory allocation.

⭐ **Supply Chain Insights Derived from This Dashboard**

1. **High-Demand SKUs Drive Inventory Strategy**
Bikes and Components show the highest sales contribution, indicating:
These categories require higher forecast accuracy
They must be prioritized for safety stock
Procurement cycles should be more frequent
Warehouse space allocation should favor these SKUs
Fast-moving SKUs directly determine stock levels, replenishment frequency, and supplier engagement.

2. **Category Contribution Helps Procurement & Budgeting**
The dashboard shows clear revenue share by category:
Bikes = High-demand + high-value
Accessories & Clothing = Stable but smaller contribution
This helps supply chain teams decide:
Which categories need **bulk purchasing**
Which categories can use **Just-in-Time** replenishment
How to allocate **warehouse storage efficiently**

3. **Top Customers Indicate Priority Account**s
Analysis of top companies reveals:
A small number of customers contribute a large percentage of revenue
These accounts should receive **priority fulfillment**
Stock levels must be aligned to their demand cycles
Dedicated service-level agreements can be created
This improves order reliability and customer satisfaction.

4. **Geographic Demand Guides Distribution Network Planning**
From the global and US maps:
Certain cities and US states show **very high sales density**
These locations are ideal for:
Regional DCs (Distribution Centers)
Micro-fulfillment nodes
Optimized last-mile routing

Supply chain planners can reduce logistics costs by aligning **inventory placement with demand hotspots.**

5. **Forecasting Inputs for Supply Planning**

Demand trends by category and region help forecast:
Peak season demand
Slow-moving categories
Regional variations in product popularity

These insights enable:
Better procurement cycles
Smarter inventory buffers
Reduced stockouts
Lower holding costs

6. **SKU Performance Impacts Supplier Strategy**

High-performing items should be:
Prioritized with strategic suppliers
Negotiated with volume-based contracts
Monitored for lead-time consistency

This ensures **smooth supply continuity.**

⭐ **Business Impact**

Using this dashboard, supply chain managers can:
Make quick replenishment decisions
Plan optimal stock levels per region
Identify priority customers for strategic planning
Allocate inventory more efficiently
Drive cost savings in logistics and warehousing
Improve service levels through better forecasting
